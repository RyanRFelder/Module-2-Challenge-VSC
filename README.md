# Loan Qualifier Application (CLI)

As per the user story critereon, this simple CLI app is used to save qualifying loan data in a
'.csv' file located at the user's discretion. While most of the code was pre-written (methods, functions,etc.) I found this task moderately difficuly, though ultimately was able to develop a basic version that fulfills the assignment.

## Technologies

This program was developed with Python 3.7.9 and 3.8.5; at various stages conflicts arose with Fire as well as other libraries such as questionary, to remedy these errors, Python 3.8.5 64-Bit ('base': conda) was adopted as the primary version for the interpreter.

## Installation Guide

The following code was used to install modules:

conda create -n atmdev python=3.7 -y
conda activate atmdev
pip install fire
pip install questionary
pip install pytest

## Usage

The program's usage is intended for a Python IDE such as VS Code, its native environment. The application is launched by running the Python file, 'app.py'.

## Contributors

I would not have been able to complete this module without the help of my classmate and group member Javier Barrios, whose prompt assistance and guidance enabled me to correct my process and complete the project. Furthermore, with Javier's permission I borrowed a few lines of code, which are cited in the program where relevant.
