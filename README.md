# Loan Qualifier Application (CLI)

As per the user story critereon, this simple CLI app is used to save qualifying loan data in a
'.csv' file located at the user's discretion. While most of the code was pre-written (methods, functions,etc.) I found this task moderately difficuly, though ultimately was able to develop a basic version that fulfills the assignment.

I would not have been able to complete this module without the help of my classmate and group member Javier Barrios, whose prompt assistance and guidance enabled me to correct my process and complete the project. Furthermore, with Javier's permission I borrowed a few lines of code, which are cited in the program where relevant.
